### Laravel Migration Stubs
Larament includes custom migration stubs that removes the `down()` method by default. The removal of the `down()` method is a debated topic in the Laravel community - while some developers prefer to keep it for rollback capabilities, others find it rarely used in practice. If you prefer to keep the `down()` method, you can simply remove these custom stubs and Laravel will use its default migration templates.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

return new class() extends Migration
{
    public function up(): void
    {
        //
    }
};
```

### Helper Functions
Larament comes with a pre-configured `app/Helpers.php` file where you can define your own helper functions. The file is already set up in your `composer.json` for autoloading. Here's an example of how to add your own helper functions:

```php
if (! function_exists('example')) {
    function example(): string
    {
        return 'This is an example function you can use in your project.';
    }
}
```

## Development Commands

Larament includes a convenient composer command to streamline your development workflow:

```bash
composer review
```

This command runs all code quality tools in sequence:
- Laravel Pint for code style fixing
- Rector for automated code refactoring
- PHPStan for static analysis
- Pest for testing

## Installation

Create a new Larament project and set it up with a single command:

```bash
composer create-project codewithdennis/larament your-project-name
cd your-project-name 
composer install
npm install
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

### Create a terminal alias
For easier usage in future projects, create an alias in your terminal:

```bash
alias larament="composer create-project --prefer-dist CodeWithDennis/larament"
```

Now, you can create a new project with a simple command:

```bash
larament basecamp
```

## Development Dependencies

- **Laravel Debugbar**: A package that integrates the PHP Debug Bar into Laravel, providing insights into queries, requests, and performance metrics during development.

```bash
composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev
```
